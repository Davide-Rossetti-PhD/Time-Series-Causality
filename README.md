## üìò Overview

This repository implements and extends the methods proposed in  
[*Building causation links in stochastic nonlinear systems from data*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07701)  
by **Davide Rossetti, Sergio Chibbaro, Cyril Furtlehner, Th√©o Marchetta,** and **Andrei-Tiberiu Pantea** (2025).

The work explores how **response theory**‚Äîtraditionally used in physics to quantify how a system reacts to perturbations‚Äîcan be combined with **machine learning** to infer **causal relationships** directly from data, without explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion.

Two main classes of systems are considered:
1. **Linear stochastic processes**, modeled via Markovian dynamics and treated with Lasso-regularized regression.
2. **Nonlinear or chaotic systems**, where neural and data-driven models approximate the system evolution and its causal response.

The repository reproduces the experimental results through Jupyter notebooks and modular Python code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods and Models

### üîπ Linear and Weakly Nonlinear Systems
- Based on regression of the Markov operator \( A \) using **Lasso**.
- Evaluates the causal response function \( R_{j \to i}(t) \) through perturbation analysis.
- Implements the **Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR)** in the data-driven regime.

### üîπ Nonlinear and Chaotic Systems
- Uses **polynomial dictionary regression** (SINDy) and **MLP neural networks** to reconstruct dynamics \( \dot{x} = f(x) \).
- Applies perturbations to simulated trajectories to compute causal responses \( R_{j \to i}(\tau) = \frac{\delta x_i(t+\tau)}{\delta x_j(t)} \).
- Benchmarks the models on the **Lorenz ‚Äô63** system, comparing physical and learned responses.

### üîπ Reservoir and Nested Neural Models
- Introduces **Reservoir Computing** for high-dimensional embedding and efficient nonlinear prediction.
- Develops a **Nested Neural Network** architecture (linear + nonlinear branches) to retain physical interpretability and causal traceability.
